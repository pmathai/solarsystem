Scene Description
    A representation of our solar system.  All the currently acknowledged planets and some of their moons.  You'll have to zoom out to see neptune and uranus and saturn sometimes. The planets orbit at their own pace.  Earth's moon has it's own orbit.  Mars and Jupitor also has some moons.  Also shows our sun in a supernova.  


PROJECT4 NOTES

f = toggle fog
l = lighting toggle

might render slow due to the amount of textures.  textures are on the floor as well as the asteroids. 

the planets have materials
the sun is a light source.  emits a yellow light.
the earth also is a light source that moves.  emits a blue light.  you can see this easily on the moon that orbits earth

all the planets and sun have materials.

NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
project was created on an ubuntu machine and it requires SOIL to compile.



Controls
1 = wireframe
2 = solids
3 = rotate on center
4 = make planets to scale
5 = make planets a likeable size for viewing
6 = disables mouse
q = quit
esc = quit
w = forward
s = backward
a = strafe left
d = strafe right
z = move camera down
spacebar = move camera up
r = reset

Mouse movement
    use the left mouse button and drag across scene to move.  combining mouse and wasd movement works at first but will eventually break down.
    use right mouse button to supernova the solar system.

NOTES

idle animation = planet orbits.  moon orbits on earth and mars. asteroid belt movement
action animation = supernova started with a right mouse button click
